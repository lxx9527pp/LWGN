## Efficient Robotic Grasping via Lightweight Ghost Convolution Network

This code was developed with Python 3.8 on Ubuntu 18.04. 

## Datasets

Currently, both the [Cornell Grasping Dataset](http://pr.cs.cornell.edu/grasping/rect_data/data.php)and
[Jacquard Dataset](https://jacquard.liris.cnrs.fr/) are supported.

## Training

Training is done by the `train.py` script.  

Trained models are saved in `output/models` by default, with the validation score appended.
